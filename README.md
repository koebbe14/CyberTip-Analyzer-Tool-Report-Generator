# CAT-RG: CyberTip Analysis Tool & Report Generator

###  Click on "Releases" (to the right) and download the .exe file

## Introduction:

CAT-RG (CyberTip Analysis Tool & Report Generator) is a standalone Windows application designed to analyze CyberTipline JSON reports from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). It extracts key information such as suspect details, incident summaries, evidence (e.g., uploaded files), and IP addresses, then generates formatted reports in DOCX format. The tool also supports optional exports to text and Excel files for IP data and evidence summaries.

This tool supports various Electronic Service Providers (ESPs) and uses external services like MaxMind for geolocation and ARIN for WHOIS data on IP addresses.

Version: 2.0
Release Date: August 04, 2025
Platform: Windows 

## Features:

•	JSON Report Analysis: Parses CyberTipline JSON files to extract incident summaries, suspect information, evidence details (e.g., files, URLs, chats), and IP addresses.

•	Report Generation: Automatically creates a detailed DOCX report with sections for Incident Summary, Suspect Information, Evidence Summary, and IP Address Analysis
 o	"Customize Report Statements" feature provides the ability to add/modify/or delete statements that are exported in the "report"
    - allows user to edit the pre-formatted report statements or create "new" statements to be including in the report
    - allows for "conditional" formatting of customized report statements (for example: if ESP is facebook, add [your own custom statement] to a specific section of the report)
    
•	IP Address Analysis: Extracts unique IPs, queries MaxMind for geolocation (city/country) and ARIN for ownership (organization). Handles IPv4/IPv6, with optional query capping for large reports (>50 IPs).

•	Exports: 
  o	DOCX: Formatted police-style “initial” report.
  o	Text (.txt): Plain text version of the full report.
  o	Excel (.xlsx) for IP Data: Spreadsheet with IP, Date/Time, Port, Event, MaxMind Country/City, ARIN Organization.
  o	Excel (.xlsx) for Evidence: Spreadsheet with file details like Name, Hash, Upload Time, Tags, IP, and webpage info (e.g., URLs for X/Twitter or Reddit).

•	Credential Management: 
  o	Required: MaxMind Account ID and License Key for geolocation.
  o	Optional: ARIN API Key for higher WHOIS query limits (increases from 15/min, 256/day to 60/min, 1,000/day).

•	Investigator Info: Prompts for name and title on first run; used in reports.

•	UI Elements: 
  o	Browse button to select JSON files.
  o	Analyze button to process and generate reports.
  o	Output text area to preview reports.
  o	Status label for progress updates.
  o	Menu bar with File (Open, Save, Export, etc.) and Help options.
  o	Recent Files submenu for quick access (up to 5 files).
  o	Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+O (Open), Ctrl+S (Save), Ctrl+N (New Analysis).

•	Supported ESPs: Discord, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Imgur, Instagram, Kik, MeetMe, Microsoft (including BingImage), Reddit, Roblox, Snapchat, Sony, Synchronoss, TikTok, WhatsApp, X (Twitter), Yahoo. Other ESPs may work but are unverified.

•	Additional Notes: 
  o	Automatic saving of credentials and investigator info to JSON files for future runs.
  o	Threaded analysis for responsiveness during long queries.
  o	Error handling for invalid JSON, missing credentials, or query failures
  o	"Check for Updates" feature checks version against latest release in Github Repo
  
## Installation and Setup

Since CAT-RG is packaged as a standalone .exe using PyInstaller, no Python or additional libraries are needed on the end-user's machine. All dependencies (e.g., tkinter, openpyxl, python-docx, requests, Pillow) are bundled.

1.	Download the .exe: 
  o	Obtain the CAT-RG.exe file from the developer or distribution source.

2.	Run the Application: 
  o	Double-click CAT-RG.exe to launch.
  o	On first run: 
  	It will prompt for MaxMind credentials (see "Creating API Keys" below).
  	Then prompt for an optional ARIN API Key (recommended for high-volume use).
  	Finally, prompt for investigator name and title (required for reports).
  o	The app will create configuration files (e.g., maxmind_credentials.json, arin_credentials.json, investigator_info.json) in the same directory as the .exe. Do not delete these unless resetting credentials.

3.	Dependencies: 
  o	No manual installation needed. If running from source (not .exe), ensure Python 3.13+ and install packages via pip install requests tkinter openpyxl python-docx pillow ipaddress.

4.	Logo File: 
  o	Place a logo.jpg file (200x100 pixels recommended) in the same directory as the .exe for the app's header logo. If missing, the logo area will be blank.

5.	Windows Compatibility: 
  o	Tested on Windows 10/11. Ensure antivirus doesn't block the .exe (add exception if needed).
  o	The app requires write access to its directory for saving config files and reports.

# How to Use

Starting the Application
•	Launch CAT-RG.exe.
•	The main window shows: 
  o	"CAT-RG" title.
  o	Program name.
  o	Optional logo.
  o	File entry field and "Browse to .json" button.
  o	"Analyze CyberTip" button.
  o	Status label (starts as "Ready").

•	IP Address Analysis: Unique IPs with occurrences (date/time, port, event), MaxMind geolocation, ARIN ownership.

## Creating API Keys

MaxMind Credentials (Required)
MaxMind provides geolocation data. Credentials are free for basic use.

1.	Sign Up: 
  o	Go to https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup.
  o	Create a free account (email verification required).

2.	Generate License Key: 
  o	Log in to your MaxMind account.
  o	Under "Account" > "Services" > "License Key," generate a new key.
  o	SAVE your Account ID (displayed on the dashboard) and License Key.

3.	Enter in CAT-RG: 
  o	On first run or via Help > Update MaxMind Credentials, enter Account ID and License Key.
  o	Saved to maxmind_credentials.json for future use.

Notes: Free tier has usage limits (1,000 queries/day). For higher volume, upgrade to a paid plan.

ARIN API Key (Optional but Recommended)

ARIN provides WHOIS data. Key is free and increases query limits.
1.	Sign Up: 
  o	Go to https://www.arin.net/account/.
  o	Create a free ARIN Online account (requires email verification).

2.	Request API Key: 
  o	Log in to ARIN Online.
  o	Click on “Welcome [Your Name] in the upper right toolbar
  o	Click on “Settings”
  o	Under Security Info select “Actions”
  o	Click on “Manage API Keys”
  o	Click on “Create API Key”
  o	Copy and SAVE the generated API Key.

3.	Enter in CAT-RG: 
  o	On first run or via Help > Update ARIN API Key, enter the key (or skip for anonymous queries).
  o	Saved to arin_credentials.json.

Notes: Without a key, limits are 15 queries/min, 256/day. With key: 60/min, 1,000/day. Key is free; no payment needed.
Supported ESPs

The tool is optimized for these ESPs (others may work partially):
•	Discord
•	Dropbox
•	Facebook
•	Google
•	Imgur
•	Instagram
•	Kik
•	MeetMe (includes profile registration details, GPS notes)

•	Roblox
•	Snapchat
•	Sony
•	Synchronoss
•	TikTok (login IPs)
•	WhatsApp
•	X (Twitter) (preserved files, session IPs, profile URLs)

For unlisted ESPs, basic parsing works, but ESP-specific notes (e.g., statements) may be missing.
Troubleshooting

•	Credential Errors: If queries fail, update via Help menu. Ensure internet access.
•	IP Query Timeouts: Increase timeout in code if needed (default 10s). Use ARIN key for more queries.
•	DOCX/Excel Save Issues: Ensure write permissions; try different save locations.
•	No Logo: Add logo.jpg to .exe directory.
•	Large Reports Slow: Cap IPs at 50 or use ARIN key.
•	Errors on Launch: Check for missing config files or antivirus blocking. Run as admin if needed.
